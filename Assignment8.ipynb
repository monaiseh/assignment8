It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output). \n","* However, a huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.\n","* More specifically, during gradient descent, as we backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode\" to take very large values). \n","* The skip-connections help to address the Vanishing Gradient problem. They also make it easy for a ResNet block to learn an identity function. \n","* During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds. \n","\n","In theory, we expect having a deeper network should only help but in reality, the deeper network has higher training error, and thus test error.
